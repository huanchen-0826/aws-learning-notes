* AWS metaphor: You simply **rent** the computing power over the internet. You don't build your own power plant.
* Why use it? 
  - On demand
  - Scalability
  - Global reach
* The big 3 Service
  - EC2: compute, a virtual computer
  - S3: storage, a giant **hard drive** in the sky
  - VPC: networking
